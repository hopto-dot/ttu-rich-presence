# ãƒƒãƒ„ Rich Presence
ttu-rich-presence is a chrome extension and accompanying server that adds Discord rich presence support for [ãƒƒãƒ„ Ebook Reader](https://reader.ttsu.app/).

The extension displays the book you're reading in your Discord status, along with how long you've been reading that book.

I am not a javascript programmer but I made this extension to fill a gap of missing functionality, feel free to dis my code. And, to the devs of ãƒƒãƒ„ Ebook Reader, feel free to natively add support for this!
